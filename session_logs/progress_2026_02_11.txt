# Progress Report - February 11, 2026

## Improvements & Fixes
- **Streaming Dubbing Pipeline:** Fully implemented real-time audio streaming from ElevenLabs to the browser.
- **Audio Synchronization:** Resolved the "fast-forwarded" audio issue by matching the frontend `AudioContext` sample rate (16kHz) to the backend PCM output.
- **Gapless Playback:** Implemented a scheduling mechanism in `offscreen.js` to handle incoming audio chunks without jitter or silence gaps.
- **Target-Only Subtitles:** Modified the backend to filter out English transcripts, ensuring the UI overlay only displays the selected Indian language.
- **Multilingual Optimization:** 
    - Switched to ElevenLabs `multilingual_v2` model for superior pronunciation of Indian languages.
    - Set "Viraj" (`FmBhnvP58BK0vz65OOj7`) as the default voice for high-quality Indian accents.
- **PCM Integrity:** Added logic to ensure all streamed audio chunks are even-sized (multiples of 2 bytes) for stable PCM 16-bit decoding in the browser.

## Backend Refactoring
- Refactored `ElevenLabsService` to support async generator streaming.
- Cleaned up `main.py` pipeline logic to handle asynchronous translation and TTS triggers more efficiently.

## Known Issues / Next Steps
- **Language Support:** ElevenLabs lacks native voices for Telugu and other South Indian languages. Plan to integrate Sarvam AI's TTS for better regional coverage.
- **Latency:** Continue monitoring end-to-end latency for real-time performance.
